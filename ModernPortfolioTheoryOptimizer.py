    This function returns the negative Sharpe Ratio of a portfolio.

    Parameters:

    Returns:
    - Negative Sharpe Ratio (since minimizing -SR is the same as maximizing Sharpe Ratio).

    - It also enforces that each stock's weight is between 0 and 1 (no short selling or leverage).

    Parameters:
    - `weights`: Initial guess for portfolio weights (must sum to 1).
